        <h2>Get Started With C</h2>
            <p>To start using C, you need two things:</p>
            <p>   A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code</p>
            <p>   A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand </p>
            <p>There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).</p>
            </div>
            <div id="installC">
                <h2>C Install IDE</h2>
                    <p>An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.</p>
                    <p>Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C code.</p>
                    <p><b>Note</b>: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.</p>
                    <p>We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.</p>
                    <p>You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="Cstart">
                    <h2>C Quickstart</h2>
                        <p>Let's create our first C file.</p>
                        <p>Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.</p>
                        <p>Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c (File > Save File as):</p>
                        <div class="outer_cmd">
                            <p>Simpleprogram.c</p>
                           <div class="inner_cmd">
                            <p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; </p>

                               <p>int main() {</p>
                                 <p>printf("Hello World!");</p>
                                 <p> return 0;</p>
                                <p>}</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                            <p>Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code.</p>
                            <p>In Codeblocks, it should look like this:</p>
                            <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/c/codeblocks2020.png" alt="Image">
                            <p>Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this:</p>
                            <div class="inner_cmd">
                                <p>Hello World!</p>
                                <p>Process returned 0 (0x0) execution time : 0.011 s</p>
                                <p>Press any key to continue.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first C program.</p>
                                <p>You can try yourself in this compiler</p>
